# The Black Actors Memory Game

This game will display images of 12 famous Black actors and your objective is to obtain 12 points by clicking on each actor 1 time, but each time you click an actor the images will be shuffled in a different order. Should you click an actor twice before you receive 12 points the game will start over.

This game was developed using React and this product will be deployed on Heroku and GitHub.

Challenges: I was unable to code a screen shake and didn't quite get game messages working at appropriate times, e.g. winning, losing, etc.

Thank You
